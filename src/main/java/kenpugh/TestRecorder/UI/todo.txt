How to know how many columns on input table and therefore which columns to check

     Have a DTO that is initialized to all nulls.
     Fill it in from the input table.
     Must have some way of getting the value.
     static FieldsSupplied = all nulls
     set it up with booleans
     pass it the dataTable - it checks each field
     (if entry.get("ID") != null) fieldsupplied = true;
     boolean FieldsSupplied.check (Test a, Test b) ;

Exists - check if there, if not add it
Contains - should be there
Are - list of all of them
Now Are - checks that all are there and no others
Now contains - checks that is there
